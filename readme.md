# NetWorm

NetWorm is currently a project I'm working on. The goal is a networking library written in rust that is able to handle the mapping, visualizataion, and navigation of complex networks. Differentiation between, physical and virtual machines to give a comprehensive view of a network. Potentially later expanding into a C2 framework for cybersecurity.

Below is an example of the graphs that this program is intended to produce from provided input. Currently, the main.rs function creates a petgraph that represents the example below and prints in DOT notation. Displaying the initial implementation of the graphing system.
