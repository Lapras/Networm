# NetWorm

NetWorm is a project created by me as part of a mini-research project for CSCE465. NetWorm is a library written in rust to handle the mapping, visualization, and navigation of complex networks. Using Rust's openssh library to facilitate connections across machines. As well as the ability to print graphviz .dot file representations of networks.
