# NetWorm

NetWorm is currently a project I'm working on. The goal is a networking library written in rust that is able to handle the mapping, visualizataion, and navigation of complex networks. Differentiation between, physical and virtual machines to give a comprehensive view of a network. Potentially later expanding into a C2 framework for cybersecurity.
